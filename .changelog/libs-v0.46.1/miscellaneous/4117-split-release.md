- Starting from the next release the Namada binary apps (`namada`, `namadan`,
  `namadac` and `namadaw`) will be versioned separately from the libaries
  (everything else including the wasm). The libraries releases will have their
  tag prefixed with "lib-" and will continue with the current versioning scheme.
